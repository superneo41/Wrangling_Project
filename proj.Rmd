### 1. Problem   
Is there a relation between State Household Income, per capita Starbucks & per capita McDonald's ?
The reason I came up with this question is because I observed that there are more students in Starbucks when it is finals week. People need coffee to stay focus on the study. So I wonder if people in one state consume more Starbucks coffee, does that means these people are more productive and make that state average income higher ? Similarly, what about McDonald's ?

### 2. Data
I obtained the average household income data and population data from the CENSUS using an API key.   
I scraped the starbucks stores data from StateMaster Website:  
http://www.statemaster.com/graph/lif_sta_sto-lifestyle-starbucks-stores#definition   
I download the McDonald's stores data from Statista Website:    
https://www.statista.com/statistics/631235/number-of-mcdonald-s-us-by-state/   

### 3. Approach
I try to visualize all the data. First I plot some maps showing the household income, number of Starbucks/McDonald's to get a rough idea about which states has the high income and which states has the most Starbucks/McDonald's stores. Then I fit a simple linear regression to see if income truely related to S/M (Starbucks/McDonald's). Finally, I analyse the regression model and get some insights.


## Packages Required

```{r packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidycensus)
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
library(readxl)
library(maps)
```

```{r API,include=FALSE}
census_api_key("put your own keys here")
```
    
    
## Data Preparation
  
  
### Data 1 

scrape starbucks_by_states data from StateMaster:   
http://www.statemaster.com/graph/lif_sta_sto-lifestyle-starbucks-stores#definition   
And clean the data   
```{r data_prepare_starbucks, warning=FALSE}
url <- "http://www.statemaster.com/graph/lif_sta_sto-lifestyle-starbucks-stores#definition"
#browseURL(url)
starbucks_by_states_txt <- url %>% # create a String[] 
  read_html() %>% 
  html_nodes(".td150 , .td180 , .clickable") %>% # found the node with selector.gadget
  html_text()
state = rep(0,51)
number = rep(0,51)
for (i in 1:length(starbucks_by_states_txt)){
  if(i %% 2 == 1) state[(i+1)/2] = starbucks_by_states_txt[i]
  else number[(i+1)/2] = as.numeric(starbucks_by_states_txt[i]) # convert to numeric 
}

# clean starbucks data 
# etc. "  California:" NA , because of the "c" in 2,010, califonia number become NA
# but its the only NA, just type it in
number[1] <- 2010
# starbucks_by_states <- as.data.frame((starbucks_by_states))
# remove space before california, remove ":"
state <- str_sub(state,3)
state <- str_replace(state,":","")

starbucks_by_states <- as.tibble(state)
starbucks_by_states <- starbucks_by_states %>% mutate(number)
colnames(starbucks_by_states)[1] = "state"
colnames(starbucks_by_states)[2] = "num_of_starbucks"
# final data
head(starbucks_by_states)
# save the data
write.csv(starbucks_by_states,"starbucks.csv")
```

### Data 2   
median household income obtained from census B19013_001     
```{r data_prepare_household_income, message=FALSE}
median_household_income <- 
  get_acs(geography = "state", 
              variables = c(medincome = "B19013_001"),year = 2014)
head(median_household_income)
write.csv(median_household_income,"income.csv")
```

### Data 3
McDonaldâ€™s by states. Download from:   

https://www.statista.com/statistics/631235/number-of-mcdonald-s-us-by-state/
```{r data_prepare_McDonalds_by_state}
mcdonalds <- read_excel("McDonalds.xlsx",sheet = "Data")
mcdonalds <- mcdonalds[-c(1,2),]
colnames(mcdonalds)[1] <- "state"
colnames(mcdonalds)[2] <- "numbers"
mcdonalds$numbers <- as.numeric(mcdonalds$numbers)
mcdonalds_by_states <-mcdonalds
head(mcdonalds_by_states)
write.csv(mcdonalds_by_states,"mcdonalds.csv")
```

### Data 4
US population by states obtained from census B01003_001E
```{r data_prepare_US_Population_by_state, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
population <- get_acs(geography = "state", 
              variables = c(medincome = "B01003_001E"),year = 2014)
head(population)
write.csv(population,"pop.csv")
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis 


*If you already done the data preparation, you can always start from here !*

### Stpe 1: read in saved data
```{r read_saved_data}
starbucks_by_states <- read.csv("starbucks.csv")
population <- read.csv("pop.csv")
mcdonalds_by_states <- read.csv("mcdonalds.csv")
median_household_income <- read.csv("income.csv")
```

### Stpe 2: plot the population over states
```{r population_plot}
population$NAME <- tolower(population$NAME)
population_add_geo <- map_data("state") %>% left_join(population,by = c("region" = "NAME"))
population_add_geo %>% ggplot(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(fill= estimate))
```

### Stpe 3: plot the average income over states
```{r income_plot}
median_household_income$NAME <- tolower(median_household_income$NAME)
income_add_geo <- map_data("state") %>% 
  left_join(median_household_income,by = c("region" = "NAME"))

income_add_geo_plot <- income_add_geo %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(fill= estimate))
income_add_geo_plot
```

### Stpe 4: plot the McDonald's rate and Starbucks rate

*rate means: the number of McDonald's/Starbucks per 1000 people in each state*
```{r Star_Mc}
# Starbucks

starbucks_by_states$state <- tolower(starbucks_by_states$state)
starbucks_add_geo <- map_data("state") %>% 
  left_join(starbucks_by_states,by = c("region" = "state"))

# starbucks/population rate
starbucks_rate <- starbucks_add_geo %>% 
  left_join(population,by = c("region" = "NAME")) %>% 
  select(long,lat,group,region,num_of_starbucks,GEOID,estimate) %>% 
  mutate(rate = num_of_starbucks/estimate*1000)

starbucks_rate_plot <- starbucks_rate %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(fill= rate)) + 
  ggtitle("Num of Starbucks/1000 peoples over States") 



# McDonald's

mcdonalds_by_states$state <- tolower(mcdonalds_by_states$state)
mcdonalds_add_geo <- map_data("state") %>% 
  left_join(mcdonalds_by_states,by = c("region" = "state"))

# McDonalds/population rate
mcdonalds_rate <- mcdonalds_add_geo %>% 
  left_join(population,by = c("region" = "NAME")) %>% 
  select(long,lat,group,region,numbers,GEOID,estimate) %>% 
  mutate(rate = numbers/estimate*1000)

mcdonalds_rate_plot <- mcdonalds_rate %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(fill= rate)) + 
  ggtitle("Num of McDonald's/1000 people over States") 

# starbucks_rate_plot
starbucks_rate_plot
# mcdonalds_rate_plot
mcdonalds_rate_plot
```

#### Comments:    

**As we can see from the two maps: **   

**rate for starbucks are higher along the west coast of U.S.**  

**rate for McDonald's are higher in the middle of U.S.**  

**Is there a relation between Income and rate of Starbucks & McDonald's ?**

### Stpe 5: Analysis   
fit a regression model
```{r compare}
income_by_state <- median_household_income %>% select(state = NAME, income = estimate)
population_by_states <- population %>% select(state="NAME",pop=estimate)
compare <- income_by_state %>% 
  left_join(mcdonalds_by_states,by = "state") %>% 
  left_join(starbucks_by_states,by = "state") %>% 
  left_join(population_by_states,by = "state") %>% 
  rename(num_of_mc = numbers) %>% 
  mutate(rate_of_mc = num_of_mc/pop*1000,rate_of_star=num_of_starbucks/pop*1000) %>% 
  select(-X.x,-X.y)
```

```{r regression}
head(compare)
dat <- compare %>% select(-state,-pop)
fit <- lm(income~.,data=dat)
summary(fit)
```
#### Comments:   

**P-value for num_of_mc & num_of_starbucks are both over 0.8, indicating non-significant variables.**  

**While P-value for rate_of_mc and rate_of_star are both less than 0.1, indicating significant variables.   **

**The coefficient for rate_of_mc is `r fit$coefficients[4]`, indicating the more McDonald's per 1000 people ** **have, the lower average income in that state.**

**The coefficient for rate_of_mc is `r fit$coefficients[5]`, indicating the more Starbucks per 1000 people have, the higher average income in that state.**

```{r plot_regression}
fit_star <- lm(income~rate_of_star,data=dat)
summary(fit_star)
pred_star <- predict(fit_star,dat) 
a <- rbind(pred_star,dat$income)
barplot(a,beside = TRUE,col=c("darkblue","red"),
        legend.text = c("income predicted by starbucks_rate","true income"),
        xlab="state",
        ylab="income",main="income Vs starbuck_rate") 
```

#### Comments:   

**As shown in the barplot, we can roughly use the starbucks number per 1000 people to predict the **
**average income in a state.**

## Conclusion

![](http://rpghearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/conclusion.jpg)

1. State average household income do have relation with the number of Starbucks/McDonald's **per 1000 people** in that state (rate of Starbucks/McDonald's). But average income is not related to the number of Starbucks/McDonald's in that state   
2. The higher rate of Starbucks the higher average income of the state  
3. The higher rate of McDonald's the lower average income of the state  
4. There is pretty good linear relation between Starbucks rate and the average income. We can even roughly estimate the state average income by the starbucks rate  
5. The linear relation between income and starbucks rate doesn't necessarily mean they are in a causal relationship. There are more worth digging !
